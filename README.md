This repository contains a video showcasing a gamified training experience developed for AWAQ Estaciones Biológicas. The game, designed specifically for iPad, aims to guide new collaborators through various modules, including security, communications, and ethical code.

The interactive and user-friendly design requires players to achieve at least 80% of correct answers to pass. It offers two training paths based on the collaborator’s profile:

General Collaborators: For all new members joining AWAQ Estaciones Biológicas.
IT Collaborators: For members involved in the AWAQ Technology Program.
